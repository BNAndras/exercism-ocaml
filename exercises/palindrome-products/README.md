# Palindrome Products

Detect palindrome products in a given range.

A palindromic number is a number that remains the same when its digits are
reversed. For example, `121` is a palindromic number but `112` is not.

Given the definition of a palindromic number, we define a palindrome _product_
to be the product `c`, such that `a * b = c`, where `c` is a palindromic number and
 `a` and `b` are integers (possibly, but _not_ necessarily palindromic numbers).

For example, the palindromic number 9009 can be written as the palindrome
product: `91 * 99 = 9009`.

It's possible (and indeed common) for a palindrome product to be the product
of multiple combinations of numbers. For example, the palindrome product `9` has
the factors `(1, 9)` and `(3, 3)`.

Write a program that given a range of integers, returns the smallest and largest
palindromic product of factors within that range, along with all the factors in the range for that product.

Not all ranges of factors can produce a Palindrome, and ranges must have their max at least as large
as their min. This exercise uses the OCaml `Result.t` type to specify errors.

## Example 1

Given the range `[1, 9]` (both inclusive)...

The smallest product is `1`. Its factors are `(1, 1)`.
The largest product is `9`. Its factors are `(1, 9)`, and `(3, 3)`.

## Example 2

Given the range `[10, 99]` (both inclusive)...

The smallest palindrome product is `121`. Its factors are `(11, 11)`.
The largest palindrome product is `9009`. Its factors are `(91, 99)` and `(99, 91)`.


## Getting Started
For installation and learning resources, refer to the
[exercism help page](http://exercism.io/languages/ocaml).

## Installation
To work on the exercises, you will need `Opam` and `Core`. Consult [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org) website for instructions on how to install `opam` for your OS. Once `opam` is installed open a terminal window and run the following command to install core:

```bash
opam install core
```

To run the tests you will need `OUnit`. Install it using `opam`:

```bash
opam install ounit
```

## Running Tests
A Makefile is provided with a default target to compile your solution and run the tests. At the command line, type:

```bash
make
```

## Interactive Shell
`utop` is a command line program which allows you to run Ocaml code interactively. The easiest way to install it is via opam:
```bash
opam install utop
```
Consult [utop](https://github.com/diml/utop/blob/master/README.md) for more detail.

## Feedback, Issues, Pull Requests
The [exercism/ocaml](https://github.com/exercism/ocaml) repository on
GitHub is the home for all of the Ocaml exercises.
