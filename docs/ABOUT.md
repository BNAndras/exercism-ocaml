[OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) is an industrial strength programming language supporting functional, imperative and object-oriented styles. 
It is used as a "teaching language" by a lot of institutions. 
OCaml has a rich and powerful [type system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system) that allows the compiler to catch some mistakes early on saving the developer a huge amount of frustration. 
[Type inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference) relieves the developer from the tedium of providing all the type signatures by themselves.
